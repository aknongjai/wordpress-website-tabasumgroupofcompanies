It informs the client what specific information is collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other firms or enterprises.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup> Privacy policies typically represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed to <a class=\"new\" title=\"Data use statements (page does not exist)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_use_statements&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\">data use statements</a>, which tend to be more detailed and specific.\r\n\r\nThe exact contents of a certain privacy policy will depend upon the applicable law and may need to address requirements across geographical boundaries and legal jurisdictions. Most countries have their own legislation and guidelines of who is covered, what information can be collected, and what it can be used for. In general, data protection laws in Europe cover the private sector as well as the public sector. Their privacy laws apply not only to government operations but also to private enterprises and commercial transactions.<sup id=\"cite_ref-Cavoukian1995_3-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#cite_note-Cavoukian1995-3\">[3]</a></sup>","Privacy Policy","","inherit","closed","closed","","15-revision-v1","","","2018-12-08 13:03:01","2018-12-08 13:03:01","",15,"http://tabasum-group-of-companies.local/15-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0),
